In this example, we use R to do a simple regression and output the
results into a new Gnumeric sheet.  We use this to explain how
developers can create S functions to perform this type of task.  We
are not concerned with the details of the user interface for
specifying the predictors and response and the number of observations.

The idea is that the user provides the data for the regression in the
form of contiguous columns with the first being the response and the
remainder being the predictors.  We use the file \file{Weight.data} in
the \dir{examples} directory of the installed package.  This is taken
from the R examples for the \SFunction{lm} function, and originally
from \textit{An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models}, Annette
Dobson.  The dataset consists of $20$ obsevations for two variables,
weight and treatment group.

This constrained input format can be relaxed quite easily, but is not
important for the example.  


The user will specify a cell range to the regression function.  At
present, we must add this call to the sheet rather than use the usual
dialog for the data analysis tools. (See the Tools menu).
\begin{verbatim}
 =regress(A1:B21,1)
\end{verbatim}

We modify this a little and now have the output go to the sheet in
which the command is located.
