\section{Problem}

One of the difficulties we face when using R functions within Gnumeric
is that we must explicitly register them with Gnumeric before using
them.  This is part of the Gnumeric model and is similar in other
inter-system interfaces such as CORBA, etc.  This is more of a problem
in the context of Gnumeric since we would ideally like to register the
functions as part of the document. Integrating the function
definitions with the document makes it a fully self contained entity.
It does not depend on external scripts or documents that must be
processed to define the elements of the document.
