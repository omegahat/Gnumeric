<h1>Todo List for R-Gnumeric Plugin</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>
      Handle shared environments for functions when saving and restoring.
  <dd>
Add
<pre>
    if(TYPEOF(x) == ENVSXP && TYPEOF(y) == ENVSXP) {
        SEXP ans;
	PROTECT(ans = allocVector(LGLSXP, 1));     
        LOGICAL(ans)[0] = (x->u.envsxp.enclos == y->u.envsxp.enclos);
        UNPROTECT(3);
        return(ans);
    }
</pre>
to
<pre>SEXP do_relop_dflt(SEXP call, SEXP op, SEXP x, SEXP y)</pre>
in relop.c      



      
  <dt>
  <li> Put scrollbars on the text and list in the editor.
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li> Methods from Gnumeric.idl
  <dd>
        cursor_move()
        select_all()
        selection_append_range()
<br>
        insert column and rows.
  <p>
      Done:
      <br>
        cursor_set()
        make_cell_visible()
  <dt>
  <li> Function to switch the view to a different sheet.
  <dd> Doesn't seem to be anything in the API.

  <dt>
  <li> Documentation for functions (in XML).
  <dd> And the manuals also.
      Actually the manuals are probably best
      since the help pages are hard to view when running Gnumeric.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Finish off the "$" operators for GnumericCellRef class.
  <dd>
      background and foreground color, font, format, border
      and protection.
<p>
      Most are done, need to do the get (set almost done)
      and handle borders.
<p>
    Can't set border currently. Just need to add the code.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Like to get the S functions and initialization (registration,
      etc.) into the XML file itself rather than depending
      on the R_GNUMERIC_PROFILE setting.

  <dd>
      Instead, put them in $HOME/.gnumeric/Rprofile,
      $HOME/.gnumeric/&lt;version-number&gt;/plugins/R/Rprofile
      and the environment variable
        R_GNUMERIC_PROFILE
      <p>
    Maybe put the name of the file in a comment.
      Thinking of adding a plugin for reading and writing
      files which would just extend the existing Gnumeric
      mechanism.

  <dt>
  <li> Add a once function/argument which replaces the contents
       of the cell defining the S call with the value and so avoids
       recomputing it each time.
  <dd> Logistic problems when we save this!
      

  <dt>
  <li> getRegisteredFunctions() should take a <b>full</b> logical
       argument indicating whether a full description is desired which includes
       the argument types, etc.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Allowing setting a cell by expression.
  <dd> See <code>sheet_cell_set_expr()</code>.
       Need to figure out what the expressions look like.
      
  <dt>
  <li> Add support for the sheet pointers and methods.
  <dd> Are these the ones I have already implemented
       [, [[, etc?

  <dt>
  <li> General converter mechanism.
  <dd> Could also potentially convert S object to XML
       and then read that into gnumeric cells.

  <dt>
  <li> Add tests for the class of a reference object.
  <dd> Either at the S-level or C-level (preferrable).
       <p>
     The general mechanism is there, just haven't transitioned the
      code
       to use it.

      
  <dt>
  <li> Handle classes (and general lists?) in conversion as references.
  <dd>


</dl>

<h2>Working</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Remove a sheet.
  <dd> See removeSheet in sheet.S<p>
       Goes into an inifite loop. Not certain why, but  it is
       the routines we call in Gnumeric that cause this. Perhaps we
       need to look at the API! :-)
  <p>
   That problem is fixed now, but there is the inherent problem
  of removing a sheet causing the workbook to be recalculated
  and hence the cell expression and S call to removeSheet being
  repeated ad nauseam.
      
  <dt>
  <li> See if we can get the names of the columns.
  <dd>
       Doesn't appear that one can edit them in Gnumeric
       so they are fixed.
       So add support for using names and map them to
       column indices.
      <p>
       The names are A...Z, AA...AZ, BA...BZ, CA...CZ, ....
  
  <dt>
  <li> Add variable number of arguments handler.
  <dd>
      
  
  <dt>
  <li> Handle errors correctly.
  <dd> Replace the jump_now() with what is coming in the
      exception C-level API for R.
<p>
     Requires Defn.h to get RCNTXT definition.
     Works now, but need to get this into the R API.

  
  <dt>
  <li> Apply formatCell to a range of cells.
  <dd> Use the mechanism in updateCell().
       <p>
     Code implemented. Seems functional.
       See testFormat() and the <a href="examples/formatting">formatting</a>
      example sheet.
  
  <li> Function in S to read region of a sheet as a data frame.
  <dd> Also, function to get current selection region.
  <dt>
      See getSheetColumn() and getSheetRegion() in sheet.S.

  
  <dt>
  <li> Matrix-like [ and [&lt;- operators.
  <dd> Current ones are element-wise, not column  and row oriented.
  <p>
   Basic version done in sheet.S    

  <dt>
  <li> Text alignments must have names.
  <dd> Now done in <code>gnumeric.getAlignValue()</code>
  
  <li> Add a Gnumeric specific Profile that is sourced when we start.
  <dd> See .First.lib. 
<p>
    Extend to  multiple files separated by <code>:</code>
    (or the platform specific separator).

  <dt>
  <li> Formatting functions for a cell, range of cells, etc.
  <dd> See format.S
      <p>
    Need to figure out
      <ul>
	<li> sharing the style across the cells within
	    a column.<br>
  Done now. See updateCell() and updateSCell().
      </ul>
  

  
  <dt>
  <li> Function in S to load a file into Gnumeric.
  <dd> See workbook_read(). Need WorkbookControl.
       Can we read a file directly into a sheet, or do we need
      a new workbook.
      <p>
     Currently can start a new workbook with a file.
  <dt>        
  <li> List of the existing sheet names (and sheet references).
  <dd> See workbook.S

  <dt>
  <li>Get dim or extent of a sheet. 
  <dd> dim is the size of the bounding box.
      extent is the start and end cell of the box.

  <dt>
  <li> Recalc function.
  <dd>  See recalcBook().

  <dt>
  <li> Get the naming of new sheets to be unique.
  <dd> Use the gnumeric facility. Since we can also get the names
       of a worksheet's sheets, we can do the computations in R.
<p>
     uniqueSheetName() function in workbook.S

  <dt>
  <li> Function in S to write an object into a region of a sheet.
  <dd> See insert.S for matrix.
  <dt>
    Matrix done. Vectors also via the "[<-" function.
    Need data frames and then other "primitive"/builtin types.    


  <dt>
  <li> Want a way to determine if R is being run from within Gnumeric.
  <dd> Check the commandArgs() to see if RGnumeric is the first
      element.
