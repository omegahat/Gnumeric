<h1>Compilation</h1>

This package uses R as a plugin to Gnumeric.  To use it, you will need
(no surprises)
<dl>
  <dt> Gnumeric, and 
  <dd> R
</dl>
and you will need to have R in the form of a shared library,
<code>$R_HOME/bin/libR.so</code>. To do this, reconfigure and
recompile R using the commands <pre>
 ./configure --enable-R-shlib <i>any other arguments</i>
 make
</pre>

<p>

To install this package, you will also need the source code for <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric">gnumeric</a>. I have
used version 0.64 for the original implementation and, more recently,
versions 1.0.1, 1.0.8 and 1.0.10. The plugin may work with earlier
versions, but there is not guarantee.  We would appreciate hearing of
any problems and successes (<a
href="mailto:omega-devel@omegahat.org">omega-devel@omegahat.org</a>).
Gnumeric has its own dependencies which we will not describe here.

<p>

You need the source code for Gnumeric since a plugin needs access to
header files that are not installed when Gnumeric is installed on your
machine.  Note that you must ensure that the Gnumeric source
corresponds to the version that you run.  Ideally, you should download
the most recent version of Gnumeric and build and install it from
source. Not only will you need the source of Gnumeric, but also its
gnumeric-config.h file which is generated when you configure the
source for building. 


<p>

At this point, let's assume you have the Gnumeric source and a running
Gnumeric.  You will need to tell the configuration script for this R
package where the directory containing the Gnumeric source is located.
The directory of interest is the one containing the <b>src/</b>,
<b>plugins/</b> and <b>po/</b> directories of the gnumeric source.  If
you download the Gnumeric source and simply un-tar it, the resulting
top-level directory is the one we need.

<p>
There are two ways to specify this location.
The first is by setting the environment variable <code>GNUMERIC_DIR</code>
to the fully qualified name of the that directory.
The second is to specify it as a command line argument
to the <code>configure</code> script.
This is done 
 as the value of the <code>--with-gnumeric</code> argument
       of the configure script.
Since configure is invoked via the R INSTALL command,
passing an argument to it is slightly more complicated.
This is done as
<pre>
 R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='gnumeric/directory/' RGnumeric
</pre>


<p>

The compilation also requires access to the file named
<b>gnomesupport.h</b> that is installed with the gnome libraries.  The
configuration script attempts to find this in a variety of different
ways. As a last resort, it explicitly looks for it in the directory
<code>/usr/local/lib/gnome-libs/include/</code>.  If it is not found,
the configuration will fail. In that case, you can specify the
directory in which it is available using the environment variable
<code>EXTRA_INCLUDES</code>.



<h1>Installation</h1>

At this point, the plugin library is ready to be used in
Gnumeric. However, you must tell Gnumeric of its existence.  To do
this, you have to decide where to install the plugin library
so that gnumeric will find it when it starts.
You essentially have two choices:
<ul>
  <li> your home directory, for personal use
  <li> the system-wide plugin directory for all users,
       typically
       <code>/usr/local/lib/gnumeric/0.64/plugins</code>
</ul>

The default is to put it in your home directory, specifically in the
directory <code>.gnumeric/<i>version-number</i>/plugins/R</code>.
To install it in a different place, specify the target
directory by setting the environment variable
<code>INSTALL_DIR</code>.

<p>

The <code>cleanup</code> script will copy the file
<code>plugin.xml</code> in this distribution to the installation
directory where gnumeric looks for plugins. It will also create a
symbolic link to the shared library in the installed R library

<p>

To perform this installation as part of the R installation,
invoke <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> with the <code>-c</code>
argument.
<pre>
  R CMD INSTALL -c RGnumeric_0.1-0.tar.gz
</pre>
At this point, Gnumeric should be able to see the plugin.


<h1><a name="activation"></a>Activating the Plugin</h1>

To activate the plugin, you need to start Gnumeric. Before doing this
however, make certain that your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
environment variable includes the directory
in which libR.so is located. This is in <code>$R_HOME/bin/</code>
and you can find the value of <code>R_HOME</code>
via the command
<pre>
 R RHOME
</pre>

<p>

Now you are ready to run Gnumeric and activate the plugin.  Start
Gnumeric by issuing the command <code>gnumeric</code>.  Then, click on
the <i>Tools</i> menu and select <i>Plug-ins...</i>.  This dialog
window allows you to scroll through the list of available plugins, the
top component showing the already active ones and the lower component
showing the currently inactive ones.  If the entry <code>R
Plugin</code> is not in the Active plugins box, click on it in the
<i>Available inactive plugins</i> box and then click the <i>Activate
plugin</i> button to the right.  If all goes well, the <i>R Plugin</i>
entry should now be in the top component of the window indicating it
is active. Check the terminal console for any error messages and look
at the FAQ for how to deal with them.  Please note that you will only
need to do activate the plugin once.

<h1>Testing the Plugin</h1>

To test the plugin, you can open one of the files in the examples/
directory of this distribution.  These are installed in the <a
href="inst/examples/index.html"><code>examples/</code></a> directory.

You will need to set the environment variable
<code>R_GNUMERIC_PROFILE</code> to
<code>ExampleProfile</code> in the <code>examples/</code>
directory of the installed library.
