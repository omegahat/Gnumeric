<h1>The @PKG_NAME@ package  (version @MAJOR_VERSION@.@MINOR_VERSION@-@PATCH_LEVEL@)</h1>


This is a package that allows R to be used as a plugin for <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a>, the Gnome
spreadsheet application.  One registers R functions with Gnumeric via
R commands and these functions can then be called as if they are
built-in Gnumeric functions.  Additionally, the R functions can create
and manipulate spreadsheets and individual cells, accessing and
changing their contents, formatting and appearance attributes.

<p>

This is experimental, although the basic functionality is likely to
remain reasonably stable. The hope is to get some feedback and to
encourage others to help or take over the development of the package.

<p>

One can use the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGtk">RGtk</a>
package in R code that is called from Gnumeric to create GUI
extensions to Gnumeric and dialogs.  These can be used, for example,
to provide a command line for evaluating S commands, or a tool to
manage the registered functions.


<h2>R &amp; Excel</h2>

The <a href="../RDCOMClient">RDCOMClient</a>
and <a href="../RDCOMServer">RDCOMServer</a>packages allow one
to connect R to Excel. Similarly,
Eric Neuwirth has connected R to Excel on Windows previously using
Thomas Baier's <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/other_software/">DCOM R server</a>.
This RGnumeric package is quite different.
<p>

Primarily, it is aimed at letting the spreadsheet user call R
functions without knowing they are implemented in R and without having
to know any of the S language.  In contrast, the R-Excel interface
works by allowing the Excel user to pass S language commands directly
to S, requiring the knowledge of both systems. This can be useful for
S users, but prohibitive for regular spreadsheet users. The RGnumeric
mechanism allows evaluation of S commands as part of its model by
allowing one to export/register a Gnumeric function that evaluates a
string as an S command.

<p>

The RGnumeric interface is bi-directional. By this, we mean that while
Gnumeric computations can call R functions, R can access Gnumeric
objects including worksheets and cells within those sheets.  We can
program in Gnumeric or R as is convenient.



<h2><a name="Download">Download</a></h2>

The current version is available as a GNU-zipped tar file <a
href="@TAR_FILE@">@TAR_FILE@</a>
<p>

This is known to run on different Red Hat Linux ( modified 6.2) and
has been tested with Gnumeric 0.64 and 0.73.  And now more recently
with 1.0.8 and 1.0.10.

and using the package.
